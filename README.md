PYTHON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS: 


1. Explain Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). How does it affect multithreading?
#The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python
bytecodes at once. It can limit the performance of CPU-bound programs in multi-core systems because only one thread can execute Python
code at a time, though I/O-bound programs benefit from multithreading.
2. What is the difference between deepcopy() and copy() in Python?
#Copy() creates a shallow copy of an object, meaning it only copies the outer object, while references to nested objects
are preserved. deepcopy() creates a full copy, including nested objects, so changes in the copied object do not affect the original.
3. How does Python's memory management work? Explain garbage collection in Python.
#Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to manage memory. Reference counting is the primary
method; when an objectâ€™s reference count drops to zero, it's immediately deallocated. The cyclic garbage collector identifies and cleans up
cyclic references that are not freed by reference counting.
4. How would you implement a singleton pattern in Python?
#You can implement a singleton pattern using various approaches in Python, such as by overriding the __new__ method,
using a class-level variable, or employing a decorator or metaclass to ensure only one instance of the class is created.
5. What are Python generators? How do they differ from regular functions?
#Generators are functions that yield values one at a time, allowing iteration over potentially large datasets without storing
the entire dataset in memory. They differ from regular functions by using yield instead of return, and they return an iterator.

SQL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

1. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN in SQL?
#INNER JOIN returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. OUTER JOIN returns all the rows from one table
and the matching rows from the other table (can be LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL OUTER JOIN).
2. What  is the purpose of indexing in SQL? How does it improve query performance?
#Indexes allow the database to find data faster by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned. They improve
query performance by enabling faster retrieval of records, though they can slow down write operations (insertions, updates, and deletions)
due to the need to update the index.
3. Explain the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses.
#WHERE filters rows before any grouping is done, while HAVING is used to filter groups after the GROUP BY clause has been
applied.
4. How would you retrieve the second-highest salary from an Employee table?
#There are several ways, one common approach:
sql
Copy code
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
5. What is a self-join and when would you use it?
#A self-join is when a table is joined with itself, typically used to compare rows within the same table. This is useful in
scenarios like finding employees who are managers of other employees within the same tabl
